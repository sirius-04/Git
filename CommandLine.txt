ls = list the files & folders in the current folder

cd (folder path) = change directory

git init = initialize (setup) Git in the folder

git status = tell us what changes have been made since the previous version

TO ADD A VERSION TO VERSION HISTORY {
    git add (filename)= pick which changes we want in our next version

    . = the whole current folder
        git add . = add the whole folder into the next version

    git commit -m "describe the version changes" = to create a new version. Commit means version. -m means attaching message to that commit
    May encounter this error: 
        Author identity unknown

        *** Please tell me who you are.

        Run

        git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
        git config --global user.name "Your Name"

        to set your account's default identity.
        Omit --global to set the identity only in this repository.

        fatal: unable to auto-detect email address (got 'Chan Yong Liang@YongLiang-Laptop.(none)')
    To fix that:
        git config --global user.email "chan.yongliang7406@gmail.com"
        git config --global user.name "Chan Yong Liang"

    git log = to view version history
}

TO MAKE CHANGES ON PREVIOUS COMMIT MADE {
    git add (filename or .)
    git commit -m"Version1" --amend (--ammend means the changes will be applied on the previous commit instead of creating a new one)
}

STAGE {
    git add (filename or .) = add them to staged CHANGES
    git reset (filename or .) = remove them from the staged changes
    
}
